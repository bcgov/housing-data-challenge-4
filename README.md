## Some thoughts

The app should obviously have some drill-down capabilities, where users can see overall trends, then zoom-in to reveal detailed information for specific region(s). However, as Figure \@ref(fig:regions) shows, there are many types of regions!

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="regions.png" alt="Different types of regions available in the forecast of households." width="337" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:regions)Different types of regions available in the forecast of households.</p>
</div>

Eventually it may be useful to alter the type of region(s), but for now, it seems "regional districts" is the best default type.
