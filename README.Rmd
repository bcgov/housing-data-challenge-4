## Some thoughts

The app should obviously have some drill-down capabilities, where users can see overall trends, then zoom-in to reveal detailed information for specific region(s). However, as Figure \@ref(fig:regions) shows, there are many types of regions!

```{r regions, fig.cap = "Different types of regions available in the forecast of households."}
knitr::include_graphics("regions.png")
```

Eventually it may be useful to alter the type of region(s), but for now, it seems "regional districts" is the best default type.
